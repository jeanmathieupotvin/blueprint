Blueprint is an efficient generator of data schemas that aims to work for any
kind of R objects. A *schema* is usually a concise description of how an object
(such a `list` or a `data.frame`) is structured. It dictates what it *should*
contain and how it *should* be structured. Hence, the name of the package:
`blueprint`.

Upper cases can be annoying. Grammar can be too. When referring to the package,
use whatever you prefer between `Blueprint` or `blueprint`. Just keep in mind
that `blueprint` is the namespace's true name and that `Blueprint` is its core
super-class (there is a `Blueprint` binding exported to that namespace that
points to a class definition).

# Installation

Blueprint is still at an early stage of its development cycle. Best is to not
install and/or use it for now.

# Contributions

Blueprint is a personal project. Once it reaches a more comfortable
state, I will gladly open the development process to everyone!
